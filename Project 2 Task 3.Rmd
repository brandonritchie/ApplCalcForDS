## Maximum Likelihood Method for Function 1

We will consider the model $f_1(t; a_1) = 100 + a_1t$. The loglikelihood for this function will be as follows:

$$\ell_1(a_1; \mathbf{t}, \mathbf{y}) = 44\ln(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}) + -\frac{1}{2}\sum_i^{44}-(y_i - 100-a_1t_i)^2$$

We want to find the maximum of $\ell_1$ so we will take the derivative with repect to $a_1$. This was done with the following hand calculation:

![](first_deriv_1.jpg)

To find the critical point we will set the derivative equal to 0 and solve for $a_1$. When it is simplified we get the following function:

$$a_1 = \frac{\sum{y_i-100}}{\sum{t_i}}$$

```{r}
t <- bulb$hours
y <- bulb$percent_intensity

a1 <- sum(y - 100) / sum(t)
```

When we plug it into R we get a critical point of $0.0004728455$. We can now do the second derivative test to calculate whether this is a local minima or maxima. The following image shows the calculation for the second derivative:

![](second_deriv_1.jpg)

```{r}
-sum(t^2)
```

We get $-328,767,530$ for the second derivative test, so we know that we have a maximum.

We will now fit it visually:

```{r}
f1 <- function(x,a1=0){
  100 + a1*x
}

x <- seq(-10,80001,2)
par(mfrow=c(1,2),mar=c(2.5,2.5,1,0.25))
plot(t,y,xlab="Hour ", ylab="Intensity(%) ", pch=16,main='f1')
lines(x,f1(x,a1),col=2)
plot(t,y,xlab="Hour ", ylab="Intensity(%) ", pch=16, xlim = c(-10,80000),ylim = c(-10,120))
lines(x,f1(x,a1),col=2)

```

## Maximum Likelihood Method for Function 4

We will consider the model $f_4(t; a_1,a_2) = 100 + a_1t + a_2\ln(0.005t+1)$. The loglikelihood function for this model is as follows:
